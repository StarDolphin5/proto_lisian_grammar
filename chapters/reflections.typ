Why go through all this trouble, especially for a proto-lang?

During the process of working on Minglis, I got to the point where I actually needed names to make meaningful characters and events, and since a variety of cultures were built into my world, this came with the need for a naming language. It so happens that this need for a naming language coincided with a rise in my motivation after months of severe clinical depression, and, being autistic, such a rise in motivation came with a hyperfixation on an aspect of my special interest-linguistics-which I was particularly weak on, namely syntax theory. Cue a month or two (or three) of deep engagement with the LFG literature.

Why LFG? I did pick up and read on the dominant theoretical framework, transformational grammar (i.e. Minimalism), but I was honestly not impressed with its efforts to reduce everything to syntax, except when it didn't (morphology, the phonological interface, the semantic interface), as well as movement after movement up functional heads. I also felt it didn't capture cross-linguistic phenomena elegantly enough.

While doing a survey of theories, the next one I bumped on was LFG, and... the community is certainly enthusiastic and convincing.

I fell into LFG through @lowe_minimal_2020, since their proposal Minimal Phrase Structure has a similar name to Minimalism and Bare Phrase Structure. They explicitly acknowledge their work is within the framework of LFG, which pointed me in that direction afyer being curious about its assumptions, such as language-speciric phrade-structure rules and exocentric categories.

It's an active researxh field with an over 2000 page handbook as recent as 2023. I liked its modularity and diverse levels of representation, which seems intuitively reasonable and which Minimalism does use despite its pretensions to the contrary.

At some stage the past vs nonpast distinction began to contribute to a system of aspect and evidentiality. The two former tenses now combine with the mood system and with previously sentence initial (now prefix on the sentence initial verb) complementizers to create the evidentiality system.

== Evidentials

- complementizers:
  - One meaning either “people (in general) say that” or “(I) heard that” (descends from #LL[ro])
- The former nonpast is used as inferential, so it is also used in the protasis of low-hypotheticality past-time-reference conditional sentences
  - In English these look like *If the students came on Friday, they had oral practice in Quechua*, where we don’t know whether the students did in fact come on Friday.
  - This could look like `if come-IND-3P students on Friday, have-IND-IPFV-3P practice oral in Quechua`
- The former past is used as direct evidential

Èbèr edi

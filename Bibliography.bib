Kaplan, which assumes that language is best described andmodeled by parallel structures representing different facets oflinguistic organization and information, related by means offunctional correspondences. This volume has five parts. Part I,Overview and Introduction, provides an introduction to core syntacticconcepts and representations. Part {II}, Grammatical Phenomena, {reviewsLFG} work on a range of grammatical phenomena or constructions. {PartIII}, Grammatical modules and interfaces, provides an overview of {LFGwork} on semantics, argument structure, prosody, information structure,and morphology. Part {IV}, Linguistic disciplines, reviews {LFG} work inthe disciplines of historical linguistics, learnability,psycholinguistics, and second language learning. Part V, Formal andcomputational issues and applications, provides an overview ofcomputational and formal properties of the theory, implementations,and computational work on parsing, translation, grammar induction, andtreebanks. Part {VI}, Language families and regions, reviews {LFG} workon languages spoken in particular geographical areas or in particularlanguage families. The final part, Comparing {LFG} with otherlinguistic theories, discusses {LFG} work in relation to othertheoretical approaches.},

	abstract = {X' theory was a major milestone in the history of the development of generative grammar.1 It enabled important insights to be made into the phrase structure of human language, but it had a number of weaknesses, and has been essentially replaced in Chomskyan generativism by Bare Phrase Structure ({BPS}), which assumes fewer theoretical primitives than X0 theory, and also avoids several of the latter’s weaknesses. However, Bare Phrase Structure has not been widely adopted outside the Minimalist Program ({MP}), rather, X0 theory remains widespread. In this paper, we develop a new, fully formalized approach to phrase structure which incorporates insights and advances from {BPS}, but does not require the Minimalist-specific assumptions that come with {BPS}. We formulate our proposal within Lexical-Functional Grammar ({LFG}), providing an empirically and theoretically superior model for phrase structure compared with standard versions of X0 theory current in {LFG}.},

	doi = {10.15398/jlm.v1i1.56},
	abstract = {Construction Grammar holds that unpredictable form-meaning combinations are not restricted in size. In particular, there may be phrases that have particular meanings that are not predictable from the words that they contain, but which are nonetheless not purely idiosyncratic. In addressing this observation, some construction grammarians have not only weakened the word/phrase distinction, but also denied the lexicon/grammar distinction. In this paper, we consider the word/phrase and lexicon/grammar distinction in light of Lexical-Functional Grammar and its Lexical Integrity Principle. We show that it is not necessary to remove the word/phrase distinction or the lexicon/grammar distinction to capture constructional effects, although we agree that there are important generalizations involving constructions of all sizes that must be captured at both syntactic and semantic levels. We use {LFG}’s templates, bundles of grammatical descriptions, to factor out grammatical information in such a way that it can be invoked either by words or by construction-specific phrase structure rules. Phrase structure rules that invoke specific templates are thus the equivalent of phrasal constructions in our approach, but Lexical Integrity and the separation of word and phrase are preserved. Constructional effects are captured by systematically allowing words and phrases to contribute comparable information to {LFG}’s level of functional structure; this is just a generalization of {LFG}’s usual assumption that “morphology competes with syntax” (Bresnan, 2001).},

After introducing some preliminary concepts, the chapter explores various approaches within {LFG}: the earliest work using lexical rules to explain argument alternations, the ``classical'' version of Lexical Mapping Theory ({LMT}) developed in the late '80s and early '90s, and  various subsequent modifications, extensions, and reimaginings of {LMT}, including contemporary work focussing on the formal status of argument structure and mapping theory, and their connection to the rest of the grammar.},

This book is a cross-linguistic study of how differential object marking is affected by information structure, the structuring of the utterance in accordance with the informational value of its elements and contextual factors. Marked objects tend to be associated with old information or information that the sentence is about, while unmarked objects tend to express new information. The book also sheds light on grammatical patterning in languages with differential object marking: in some languages marked and unmarked objects have identical grammatical properties, whereas in other languages marked objects are more active in syntax. Finally, it provides a theory of the historical changes that lead to the emergence of various patterns of differential object marking"--},

The authors provide detailed and extensive coverage of the analysis of syntax, semantics, morphology, prosody, and information structure, and how these aspects of linguistic structure interact in the nontransformational framework of {LFG}. The book is divided into three parts. The first part examines the syntactic theory and formal architecture of {LFG}, with detailed explanations and comprehensive illustration, providing an unparalleled introduction to the fundamentals of the theory. Part two explores non-syntactic levels of linguistic structure, including the syntax-semantics interface and semantic representation, argument structure, information structure, prosodic structure, and morphological structure, and how these are related in the projection architecture of {LFG}. Chapters in the third part illustrate the theory more explicitly by presenting explorations of the syntax and semantics of a range of representative linguistic phenomena: modification, anaphora, control, coordination, and long-distance dependencies. The final chapter discusses {LFG}-based work not covered elsewhere in the book, as well as new developments in the theory. The volume will be an invaluable reference for graduate and advanced undergraduate students and researchers in a wide range of linguistic sub-fields, including syntax, morphology, semantics, information structure, and prosody, as well as those working in language documentation and description},
